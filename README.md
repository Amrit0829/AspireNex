## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview
The objective of this task is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing the distribution of features and their correlation with the target variable.
3. **Model Building**: Using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to build the model.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Results
The best model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set, with the following performance metrics:
- Precision: X%
- Recall: X%
- F1-score: X%

## Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Overview
The goal of this task is to build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions by pre-processing the transaction data, handling class imbalance issues, and training a classification algorithm.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of credit card transaction records, including features that help in identifying fraudulent transactions.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizing the transaction data, handling class imbalance using techniques like oversampling and undersampling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing the distribution of features and their correlation with the target variable.
3. **Model Building**: Using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and other ensemble methods.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Results
The best model achieved the following performance metrics:
- Precision: X%
- Recall: X%
- F1-score: X%
