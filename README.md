## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview
The objective of this task is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic.


## Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Overview
The goal of this task is to build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions by pre-processing the transaction data, handling class imbalance issues, and training a classification algorithm.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of credit card transaction records, including features that help in identifying fraudulent transactions.
